The Ambassador of Ukraine to the Republic of Kazakhstan Pyotr Vrublevsky and his family drove the cars on the road and wished the drivers a successful road.  

> "We highly appreciate the efforts and energy of our Kazakh friends, initiators and organizers of the aid collection and volunteers aimed at supporting the Ukrainian people suffering from Russian military aggression.

This was the first cargo of "humanitarian aid" sent by land transport. It contains: bulk cereals, pasta, canned food, baby food, wet wipes, sanitary pads, diapers for children and adults, children's clothing and shoes. Since the beginning of the war, more than 25 tons of humanitarian aid have already been delivered to Ukraine from Kazakhstan by air. It has already been distributed to the most needy regions of the country.

The collection of aid was organized by volunteers, starting from the first days of the war. Citizens of Kazakhstan bring medicines, stuff for children, toys, basic necessities, personal hygiene products, clothes, shoes, long-term food, blankets, sleeping bags and even pet food to the embassy every day. People of Kazakhstan also send postcards and letters to Ukrainians with words of support. In each box that will be sent to Ukraine, there is an insert with the flags of the two countries and the text: "To the people of Ukraine from the people of Kazakhstan.

> "People open their home first aid kits and carry the last one. It's unbelievable. I did not expect that our tragedy would be so close to the people of Kazakhstan. On behalf of all Ukrainian families, we sincerely thank the people Kazakh people for their continuous help and support! This is a huge contribution to the development of close relations between our peoples, who have many common pages of history, including tragic ones. Kazakhstan understands our pain, we feel it"

As the manager of the collection of aid in Nur-Sultan Rakhimbek Abdrakhmanov noted: "The Humanitarian Support Headquarters of Ukraine in Nur-Sultan works non-stop at the Embassy of Ukraine in Kazakhstan at 12 Zhylyoy Street. People can transfer aid daily from 8 to 20 hours. There is no need to call beforehand. Things/goods/medicines are accepted. To simplify sorting, all goods should be packed separately by category: products (cereals, canned food, nuts, dried fruits, cookies); things (clothes, shoes, blankets, towels and other textiles); hygiene (all personal hygiene products, napkins, diapers, toilet paper); household goods (powerbanks, dishes, baby nipples, karemats, sleeping bags, lanterns); medicines.  Volunteers receive, sort and pack goods for further transportation. During peak days, they also work at night. Procurement and information support services of the headquarters have also been created. In general, more than 100 volunteers are already helping the headquarters."

> "We have put aside our main work and studies in order to somehow help Ukrainians in these difficult times. We believe and know that our humanitarian mission right now is the real help that we are able to provide in support of the Ukrainian people. Volunteers put their hearts and souls into this work. We are going through this difficult period together with Ukrainians"
