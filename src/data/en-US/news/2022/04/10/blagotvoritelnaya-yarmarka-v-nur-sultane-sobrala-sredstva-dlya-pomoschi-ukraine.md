The fair opened a literary evening - all guests of the event could purchase goods, the proceeds from the sales of which will go to charity.

One of the "golden" lots of the fair were handmade postcards - the result of a master class in scrapbooking. Also at the fair it was possible to buy badges in the colors of the Ukrainian flag and badges with a trident from the coat of arms of Ukraine, paintings and dream catchers, as well as postcards depicting paintings by artists (printed with their permission) and stickers. Sales at the charity fair helped to raise 97,139 tenge, and all this amount will be used to help the Ukrainian people.
