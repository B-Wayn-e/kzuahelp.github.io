Maria told about the Cossack Baroque and one of the most important representatives of this style - the wandering philosopher Grigory Skovoroda. Then all the guests turned to poetry, and during the evening the poems of the Ukrainian writer of the Sixties and poetess Lina Kostenko were repeatedly heard. The guests of the litvoyazh also learned about life and got acquainted with the works of such Ukrainian writers and poets as Oksana Zabuzhko, Anna Yablonskaya, Vladimir Sosyura. The poetry of contemporaries Alexander Kabanov and Andrey Lyubk was also heard, who were told about the passing evening - the poets conveyed words of gratitude to all Kazakhstan people for their help and support. After poetry, it turned out to plunge into the world of fashion: Irina gave a whole lecture on the history of Ukrainian folk costume, and now all the guests of the evening know what plakhta, ducat, namisto, gerset and spare tire mean to Ukrainian girls.
